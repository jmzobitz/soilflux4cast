  abstract = {In the wake of climate change, extreme events such as heatwaves are considered to be key players in the terrestrial biosphere. In the past decades, the frequency and severity of heatwaves have risen substantially, and they are projected to continue to intensify in the future. One key question is therefore: how do changes in extreme heatwaves affect the carbon cycle? Although soil respiration (Rs) is the second largest contributor to the carbon cycle, the impacts of heatwaves on Rs have not been fully understood. Using a unique set of continuous high frequency in-situ measurements from our field site, we characterize the relationship between Rs and heatwaves. We further compare the Rs response to heatwaves across ten additional sites spanning the contiguous United States (CONUS). Applying a probabilistic framework, we conclude that during heatwaves Rs rates increase significantly, on average, by \textasciitilde\,26\% relative to that of non-heatwave conditions over the CONUS. Since previous in-situ observations have not measured the Rs response to heatwaves (e.g., rate, amount) at the high frequency that we present here, the terrestrial feedback to the carbon cycle may be underestimated without capturing these high frequency extreme heatwave events.},

  abstract = {Globally, soils store two to three times as much carbon as currently resides in the atmosphere, and it is critical to understand how soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and uptake will respond to ongoing climate change. In particular, the soil-to-atmosphere CO2 flux, commonly though imprecisely termed soil respiration (RS), is one of the largest carbon fluxes in the Earth system. An increasing number of high-frequency RS measurements (typically, from an automated system with hourly sampling) have been made over the last two decades; an increasing number of methane measurements are being made with such systems as well. Such high frequency data are an invaluable resource for understanding GHG fluxes, but lack a central database or repository. Here we describe the lightweight, open-source COSORE (COntinuous SOil REspiration) database and software, that focuses on automated, continuous and long-term GHG flux datasets, and is intended to serve as a community resource for earth sciences, climate change syntheses and model evaluation. Contributed datasets are mapped to a single, consistent standard, with metadata on contributors, geographic location, measurement conditions and ancillary data. The design emphasizes the importance of reproducibility, scientific transparency and open access to data. While being oriented towards continuously measured RS, the database design accommodates other soil-atmosphere measurements (e.g. ecosystem respiration, chamber-measured net ecosystem exchange, methane fluxes) as well as experimental treatments (heterotrophic only, etc.). We give brief examples of the types of analyses possible using this new community resource and describe its accompanying R software package.},

  abstract = {Calibrating process-based models using multiple constraints often improves the identifiability of model parameters, helps to avoid several errors compensating each other and produces model predictions that are more consistent with underlying processes. However, using multiple constraints can lead to predictions for some variables getting worse. This is particularly common when combining data sources with very different sample sizes. Such unbalanced model-data fusion efforts are becoming increasingly common, for example when combining manual and automated measurements. Here we use a series of simulated virtual data experiments that aim to demonstrate and disentangle the underlying cause of issues that can occur when calibrating models with multiple unbalanced constraints in combination with systematic errors in models and data. We propose a diagnostic tool to help identify whether a calibration is failing due to these factors. We also test the utility of adding terms representing uncertainty in systematic model/data systematic error in calibrations. We show that unbalanced data by itself is not the problem---when fitting simulated data to the `true' model, we can correctly recover model parameters and the true dynamics of latent variables. However, when there are systematic errors in the model or the data, we cannot recover the correct parameters. Consequently, the modelled dynamics of the low data volume variables departs significantly from the true values. We demonstrate the utility of the diagnostic tool and show that it can also be used to identify the extent of the imbalance before the calibration starts to ignore the more sparse data. Finally, we show that representing uncertainty in model structural errors and data biases in the calibration can greatly improve the model fit to low-volume data, and improve coverage of uncertainty estimates. We conclude that the underlying issue is not one of sample size or information content per se, despite the popularity of ad hoc approaches that focus on `weighting' datasets to achieve balance. Our results emphasize the importance of considering model structural deficiencies and data systematic biases in the calibration of process-based models.},

However, the way in which plant ecologists use and interpret these models differs from the way in which they are presented in the broader academic literature. In contrast to calls from earlier reviews, most studies of plant populations are based on {$<$} 5 matrices and present simple metrics such as deterministic population growth rates. However, plant ecologists also cautioned against literal interpretation of model predictions. Although academic studies have emphasized testing quantitative model predictions, such forecasts are not the way in which plant ecologists find matrix models to be most useful. Improving forecasting ability would necessitate increased model complexity and longer studies. Therefore, in addition to longer term studies with better links to environmental drivers, priorities for research include critically evaluating relative/comparative uses of matrix models and asking how we can use many short-term studies to understand long-term population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Two foundational questions about sustainability are ``How are ecosystems and the services they provide going to change in the future?'' and ``How do human decisions affect these trajectories?'' Answering these questions requires an ability to forecast ecological processes. Unfortunately, most ecological forecasts focus on centennial-scale climate responses, therefore neither meeting the needs of near-term (daily to decadal) environmental decision-making nor allowing comparison of specific, quantitative predictions to new observational data, one of the strongest tests of scientific theory. Near-term forecasts provide the opportunity to iteratively cycle between performing analyses and updating predictions in light of new evidence. This iterative process of gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting models and methods is critical for improving forecasts. Iterative, near-term forecasting will accelerate ecological research, make it more relevant to society, and inform sustainable decision-making under high uncertainty and adaptive management. Here, we identify the immediate scientific and societal needs, opportunities, and challenges for iterative near-term ecological forecasting. Over the past decade, data volume, variety, and accessibility have greatly increased, but challenges remain in interoperability, latency, and uncertainty quantification. Similarly, ecologists have made considerable advances in applying computational, informatic, and statistical methods, but opportunities exist for improving forecast-specific theory, methods, and cyberinfrastructure. Effective forecasting will also require changes in scientific training, culture, and institutions. The need to start forecasting is now; the time for making ecology more predictive is here, and learning by doing is the fastest route to drive the science forward.},

Here, we take a critical look at the information infrastructure that connects ecosystem modeling and measurement efforts, and propose a roadmap to community cyberinfrastructure development that can reduce the divisions between empirical research and modeling and accelerate the pace of discovery. A new era of data-model integration requires investment in accessible, scalable, and transparent tools that integrate the expertise of the whole community, including both modelers and empiricists. This roadmap focuses on five key opportunities for community tools: the underlying foundations of community cyberinfrastructure; data ingest; calibration of models to data; model-data benchmarking; and data assimilation and ecological forecasting. This community-driven approach is a key to meeting the pressing needs of science and society in the 21st century.},

  abstract = {Process-based ecosystem models help us understand and predict ecosystem processes, but using them has long involved a difficult choice between performing data- and labor-intensive site-level calibrations or relying on general parameters that may not reflect local conditions. Hierarchical Bayesian (HB) calibration provides a third option that frees modelers from assuming model parameters to be completely generic or completely site-specific and allows a formal distinction between prediction at known calibration sites and ``out-of-sample'' prediction to new sites. Here, we compare calibrations of a process-based dynamic vegetation model to eddy-covariance data across 12 temperate deciduous Ameriflux sites fit using either site-specific, joint cross-site, or HB approaches. To be able to apply HB to computationally demanding process-based models we introduce a novel emulator-based HB calibration tool, which we make available through the PEcAn community cyberinfrastructure. Using these calibrations to make predictions at held-out tower sites, we show that the joint cross-site calibration is falsely over-confident because it neglects parameter variability across sites and therefore underestimates variance in parameter distributions. By showing which parameters show high site-to-site variability, HB calibration also formally gives us a structure that can detect which process representations are missing from the models and prioritize errors based on the magnitude of the associated uncertainty. For example, in our case-study, we were able to identify large site-to-site variability in the parameters related to the temperature responses of respiration and photosynthesis, associated with a lack of thermal acclimation and adaptation in the model. Moving forward, HB approaches present important new opportunities for statistical modeling of the spatiotemporal variability in modeled parameters and processes that yields both new insights and improved predictions.},

These developments are widely viewed as an important step in developing greater realism in predictions of future ecosystem states and fluxes. Increased realism, however, leads to increased model complexity, with new features raising a suite of ecological questions that require empirical constraints. Here, we review the developments that permit the representation of plant demographics in ESMs, and identify issues raised by these developments that highlight important gaps in ecological understanding. These issues inevitably translate into uncertainty in model projections but also allow models to be applied to new processes and questions concerning the dynamics of real-world ecosystems. We argue that stronger and more innovative connections to data, across the range of scales considered, are required to address these gaps in understanding. The development of first-generation land surface models as a unifying framework for ecophysiological understanding stimulated much research into plant physiological traits and gas exchange. Constraining predictions at ecologically relevant spatial and temporal scales will require a similar investment of effort and intensified inter-disciplinary communication.},

Accelerating environmental challenges increases the need to focus synthesis science on the most pressing questions. To leverage input from the broader research community, we convened a virtual workshop with participants from many countries and disciplines to examine how and where synthesis can address key questions and themes in ecology and environmental science in the coming decade. Seven priority research topics emerged: (1) diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ), (2) human and natural systems, (3) actionable and use-inspired science, (4) scale, (5) generality, (6) complexity and resilience, and (7) predictability. Additionally, two issues regarding the general practice of synthesis emerged: the need for increased participant diversity and inclusive research practices; and increased and improved data flow, access, and skill-building. These topics and practices provide a strategic vision for future synthesis in ecology and environmental science.},

  abstract = {Owing to its tendency to couple with multiple elements, carbon forms complex molecules, which is the basic chemistry of life. Given that the climate system is inextricably coupled with the biosphere, understanding the terrestrial mechanistic pathway of carbon is critical in the transformation of the augmenting atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in future. Although the global terrestrial carbon sink reduces the accumulation of atmospheric CO2, which is contingent on the climate and ecosystem, the underlying key biophysical function that controls the ecosystem-carbon-climate responses and their feedback is uncertain. Accordingly, numerous unprecedented multi-scale studies have highlighted the dynamics of terrestrial carbon by strategically employing in situ, earth observation and process-based models; however, to date, the driving force for its dynamics remains unclassified. Besides, the significant variability in carbon is related to the large uncertainties from changes in land use, unambiguously increasing the regional carbon source from the seasonal to interannual scale but without long-term positive or negative feedback. Accordingly, in this review, we attempt to present a holistic understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle by addressing its nature and different key drivers. The heterogenetic data platforms that reliably address the terrestrial carbon sink and its source dynamics are discussed in detail to demonstrate the potential of systematic quantification. Moreover, we summarize the complexity of carbon-climate feedbacks and their associates, extending the pathway for understanding the recent terrestrial carbon allocation, where India's environment is highlighted. This comprehensive review can be valuable to the research community in understanding the importance of the present and future carbon-climate feedback.},

  abstract = {Time series of wetland methane fluxes measured by eddy covariance require gap-filling to estimate daily, seasonal, and annual emissions. Gap-filling methane fluxes is challenging because of high variability and complex responses to multiple drivers. To date, there is no widely established gap-filling standard for wetland methane fluxes, with regards both to the best model algorithms and predictors. This study synthesizes results of different gap-filling methods systematically applied at 17 wetland sites spanning boreal to tropical regions and including all major wetland classes and two rice paddies. Procedures are proposed for: 1) creating realistic artificial gap scenarios, 2) training and evaluating gap-filling models without overstating performance, and 3) predicting half-hourly methane fluxes and annual emissions with realistic uncertainty estimates. Performance is compared between a conventional method (marginal distribution sampling) and four machine learning algorithms. The conventional method achieved similar median performance as the machine learning models but was worse than the best machine learning models and relatively insensitive to predictor choices. Of the machine learning models, decision tree algorithms performed the best in cross-validation experiments, even with a baseline predictor set, and artificial neural networks showed comparable performance when using all predictors. Soil temperature was frequently the most important predictor whilst water table depth was important at sites with substantial water table fluctuations, highlighting the value of data on wetland soil conditions. Raw gap-filling uncertainties from the machine learning models were underestimated and we propose a method to calibrate uncertainties to observations. The python code for model development, evaluation, and uncertainty estimation is publicly available. This study outlines a modular and robust machine learning workflow and makes recommendations for, and evaluates an improved baseline of, methane gap-filling models that can be implemented in multi-site syntheses or standardized products from regional and global flux networks (e.g., FLUXNET).},

Comprehensive knowledge of this ratio's global distribution and its biome-specific drivers is notably limited. Based on the newest Global Soil Respiration Database, we conducted a systematic analysis of Ra/Rh in a global assessment of 404 independent studies, considering both direct and indirect effects of climatic, edaphic and vegetation features on Ra/Rh. The study proceeded by using machine-learning and conventional techniques, leveraging extreme gradient boosting (xgboost) in the isolation of crucial biophysical variables in the calculation of Ra/Rh and structural equation modeling (SEM) in discerning potential causal relationships among retained variables. Our results showed that the global average Ra/Rh was 0.66 \textpm{} 0.21 (mean \textpm{} standard deviation), and strongly regulated by mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and soil properties. Variation in soil organic-carbon-to-nitrogen ratios (i.e., C:N) and soil bulk density had distinct influence on root respiration and microbe-induced decomposition. Specifically, higher soil C: N signaled nitrogen scarcity, which suppressed plant growth and, consequently, root respiration (Ra). Meanwhile, microbes continued to maintain near-unchanged heterotrophic respiration rates (Rh) by accessing soil organic matter as food substrate. This differential response contributed to the global variations in Ra/Rh. Vegetation-related variables, such as leaf area index and net primary production, exhibited a biphasic influence on Ra/Rh, with Ra/Rh initially declining due to higher aboveground biomass allocation, and subsequently increasing as plants shifted biomass accumulation belowground. Our findings underscored the complex interplay among climatic, soil and vegetation factors in shaping root and microbial activity, providing valuable insights into belowground C dynamics. However, uncertainties remain regarding the differentiation across various regions and seasons.},

  abstract = {Soil respiration (Rs) represents the greatest carbon dioxide flux from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere. However, its environmental drivers are not fully understood, and there are still significant uncertainties in soil respiration model estimates. This study aimed to estimate the spatial distribution pattern and driving mechanism of global soil respiration by constructing a machine learning model method based on ecological big data. First, we constructed ecological big data containing five categories of 27-dimensional environmental factors. We then used four typical machine learning methods to develop the performance of machine learning models under four training strategies and explored the relationship between soil respiration and environmental factors. Finally, we used the RF machine learning algorithm to estimate the global Rs spatial distribution pattern in 2021, driven by multiple dimensions of environmental factors, and derived the annual soil respiration values. The results showed that RF performed better under the four training strategies, with a coefficient of determination R2 = 0.78216, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 285.8964 gCm-2y-1, and mean absolute error (MAE) = 180.4186 gCm-2y-1, which was more suitable for the estimation of largescale soil respiration. In terms of the importance of environmental factors, unlike previous studies, we found that the influence of geographical location was greater than that of MAP. Another new finding was that enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2) had a higher contribution to soil respiration estimates than the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized vegetation index (NDVI). Our results confirm the potential of utilizing ecological big data for spatially large-scale Rs estimations. Ecological big data and machine learning algorithms can be considered to improve the spatial distribution patterns and driver analysis of Rs.},

To address these barriers, we created a computational platform that pairs meteorological data and site-level ecosystem characterizations from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) with the Community Terrestrial System Model (CTSM) that is developed with university partners at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). This NCAR-NEON system features a simplified user interface that facilitates access to and use of NEON observations and NCAR models. We present preliminary results that compare observed NEON fluxes with CTSM simulations and describe how the collaboration between NCAR and NEON that can be used by the global change research community improves both the data and model. Beyond datasets and computing, the NCAR-NEON system includes tutorials and visualization tools that facilitate interaction with observational and model datasets and further enable opportunities for teaching and research. By expanding access to data, models, and computing, cyberinfrastructure tools like the NCAR-NEON system will accelerate integration across ecology and climate science disciplines to advance understanding in Earth system science and global change.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The errors and uncertainties associated with gap-filling algorithms of water, carbon, and energy fluxes data have always been one of the main challenges of the global network of microclimatological tower sites that use the eddy covariance (EC) technique. To address these concerns and find more efficient gap-filling algorithms, we reviewed eight algorithms to estimate missing values of environmental drivers and nine algorithms for the three major fluxes typically found in EC time series. We then examined the algorithms' performance for different gap-filling scenarios utilising the data from five EC towers during 2013. This research's objectives were (a) to evaluate the impact of the gap lengths on the performance of each algorithm and (b) to compare the performance of traditional and new gap-filling techniques for the EC data, for fluxes, and separately for their corresponding meteorological drivers. The algorithms' performance was evaluated by generating nine gap windows with different lengths, ranging from a day to 365 d. In each scenario, a gap period was chosen randomly, and the data were removed from the dataset accordingly. After running each scenario, a variety of statistical metrics were used to evaluate the algorithms' performance. The algorithms showed different levels of sensitivity to the gap lengths; the Prophet Forecast Model (FBP) revealed the most sensitivity, whilst the performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs), for instance, did not vary as much by changing the gap length. The algorithms' performance generally decreased with increasing the gap length, yet the differences were not significant for windows smaller than 30 d. No significant differences between the algorithms were recognised for the meteorological and environmental drivers. However, the linear algorithms showed slight superiority over those of machine learning (ML), except the random forest (RF) algorithm estimating the ground heat flux (root mean square errors -- RMSEs -- of 28.91 and 33.92 for RF and classic linear regression -- CLR, respectively). However, for the major fluxes, ML algorithms and the MDS showed superiority over the other algorithms. Even though ANNs, random forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGB) showed comparable performance in gap-filling of the major fluxes, RF provided more consistent results with slightly less bias against the other ML algorithms. The results indicated no single algorithm that outperforms in all situations, but the RF is a potential alternative for the MDS and ANNs as regards flux gap-filling.},

However, a wide variety of definitions of model complexity have been proposed and used, leading to an imprecise understanding of what model complexity is and its consequences across research studies, study systems, and disciplines. Here, we propose a more explicit definition of model complexity, incorporating four facets---model class, model inputs, model parameters, and computational complexity---which are modulated by the complexity of the real-world process being modelled. We illustrate these facets with several examples drawn from ecological literature. Overall, we argue that precise terminology and metrics of model complexity (e.g., number of parameters, number of inputs) may be necessary to characterize the emergent outcomes of complexity, including model comparison, model performance, model transferability and decision support.},

However, while many studies have considered variation in productivity with latitude and climate, we lack a cohesive synthesis on how forest carbon fluxes vary globally with respect to climate and one another. Here, we draw upon 1,319 records from the Global Forest Carbon Database, representing all major forest types and the nine most significant autotrophic carbon fluxes, to comprehensively review how annual C cycling in mature, undisturbed forests varies with latitude and climate on a global scale. Across all flux variables analyzed, rates of C cycling decreased continuously with absolute latitude---a finding that confirms multiple previous studies and contradicts the idea that net primary productivity of temperate forests rivals that of tropical forests. C flux variables generally displayed similar trends across latitude and multiple climate variables, with no differences in allocation detected at this global scale. Temperature variables in general, and mean annual temperature or temperature seasonality in particular, were the best single predictors of C flux, explaining 19\%--71\% of variation in the C fluxes analyzed. The effects of temperature were modified by moisture availability, with C flux reduced under hot and dry conditions and sometimes under very high precipitation. Annual C fluxes increased with growing season length and were also influenced by growing season climate. These findings clarify how forest C flux varies with latitude and climate on a global scale. In an era when forests will play a critical yet uncertain role in shaping Earth's rapidly changing climate, our synthesis provides a foundation for understanding global patterns in forest C cycling.},

  abstract = {Stability of the soil carbon (C) pool under decadal scale variability in temperature and precipitation is an important source of uncertainty in our understanding of land--\- atmosphere climate feedbacks. This depends on how two opposing C-\-fluxes---\-influx from net primary production (NPP) and efflux from heterotrophic soil respiration (Rh)---\-respond to covariation in temperature and precipitation. There is scant evidence to judge whether field experiments which manipulate both temperature and precipitation align with Earth System Models, or not. As a result, even though the world is generally greening, whether the resultant gains in NPP can offset climate change impacts on Rh, where, and by how much, remains uncertain. Here, we use decadal-\-scale global time-\-series datasets on NPP, Rh, temperature, and precipitation to estimate the two opposing C-\-fluxes and address whether one can outpace the other. We implement machine-\-learning tools on recent (2001--\-2019) and near-\-future climate scenarios (2020--\-2040) to assess the response of both C-\-fluxes to temperature and precipitation variation. We find that changes in C-\-influx may not compensate for C-\-efflux, particularly in wetter and warmer conditions. Soil-\-C loss can occur in both tropics and at high latitudes since C-\-influx from NPP can fall behind C-\-efflux from Rh. Precipitation emerges as the key determinant of soil-\-C vulnerability in a warmer world, implying that hotspots for soil-\-C loss/gain can shift rapidly and highlighting that soil-\-C is vulnerable to climate change despite widespread greening of the world. The direction of covariation between change in temperature and precipitation, rather than their magnitude, can help conceptualize highly variable patterns in C-\-fluxes to guide soil-\-C stewardship.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial biosphere models can help identify physical processes that control carbon dynamics, including land-atmosphere CO2 fluxes, and have the potential to project the terrestrial ecosystem response to changing climate. It is important to identify ecosystem processes most responsible for model predictive uncertainty and design improved model representation and observational system studies to reduce that uncertainty. Here we identified model parameters that contribute the most uncertainty to long-term ( 100 years) projections of net ecosystem exchange, net primary production, and aboveground biomass within a mechanistic terrestrial biosphere model (Ecosystem Demography, version 2.1) ED2. An uncertainty analysis identified parameters that represent the quantum efficiency of light to photosynthetic conversion, leaf respiration and soil-plant water transfer as the highest contributors to model uncertainty regardless of time frame (annual, decadal, and centennial) and output (e.g., net ecosystem exchange, net primary production, aboveground biomass). Contrary to expectations, the contribution of successional processes related to reproduction, competition, and mortality did not increase as the time scale increased. These findings suggest that uncertainty in the parameters governing short-term ecosystem processes remains the most significant bottleneck to reducing predictive uncertainty. Key actions to reduce parameter uncertainty include more leaf-level trait measurements across multiple sites for quantum efficiency and leaf respiration rate. Further, the empirical representation of soil-plant water transfer should be replaced with a mechanistic, hydraulic representation of water flow, which can be constrained with direct measurements. This analysis focused on aboveground ecosystem processes. The impact of belowground carbon cycling, initial conditions, and meteorological forcing should be addressed in future studies.},

This uncertainty can be incorporated into models by treating parameters as random variables with distributions, rather than fixed quantities. Recent advances in uncertainty quantification methods, such as polynomial chaos approaches, allow for the analysis of models with random parameters. We introduce these methods with a motivating case study of sea ice algal blooms in heterogeneous environments. We compare Monte Carlo methods with polynomial chaos techniques to help understand the dynamics of an algal bloom model with random parameters. Modelling key parameters in the algal bloom model as random variables changes the timing, intensity and overall productivity of the modelled bloom. The computational efficiency of polynomial chaos methods provides a promising avenue for the broader inclusion of parametric uncertainty in ecological models, leading to improved model predictions and synthesis between models and data.},

In this research, the Global Soil Respiration Database (SRDB) and Global Geochemical Baseline (GGB) dataset were used, temporal--spatial variations of soil respiration from 1991 to 2015 and the controlling factors in soils developed from different soil parent materials were analyzed. We found, for the first time, soil respiration was significantly varied in soils developed from different soil parent materials on a global scale, which was mainly controlled by geochemical indexes such as Al/Si, MnO, CaO and P2O5. We also found that temporal variations of soil respiration during 1991--2015 in acidic plutonic rocks, acidic volcanic rocks, metamorphic rocks, siliciclastic sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments--developed soils was significantly controlled by temperature, while that of basic plutonic rocks, basic volcanic rocks, intermediate volcanic rocks, mixed sedimentary rocks and carbonate rocks--developed soils was less sensitive to temperature relatively. We conclude that temporal--spatial variations of soil respiration were correlated with soil geochemistry, which mainly depends on the stability difference caused by the bonding between soil organic carbon and soil minerals. The findings may be helpful to understand the temporal--spatial pattern of global soil respiration, moreover reveal the importance of soil geochemistry in influencing soil respiration on global scale.},

  abstract = {Soil respiration (Rs), the soil-to-atmosphere CO2 flux produced by microbes and plant roots, is a critical but uncertain component of the global carbon cycle. Our current understanding of the variability and dynamics is limited by the coarse spatial resolution of existing estimates. We predicted annual Rs and associated uncertainty across the world at 1-km resolution using a quantile regression forest algorithm trained with observations from the global Soil Respiration Database spanning from 1961 to 2011. This model yielded a global annual Rs estimate of 87.9 Pg C/year with an associated global uncertainty of 18.6 (mean absolute error) and 40.4 (root mean square error) Pg C/year. The estimated annual heterotrophic respiration (Rh), derived from empirical relationships with Rs, was 49.7 Pg C/year over the same period. Predicted Rs rates and associated uncertainty varied widely across vegetation types, with the greatest predicted rates of Rs in evergreen broadleaf forests (accounting for 20.9\% of global Rs). The greatest prediction uncertainties were in northern latitudes and arid to semiarid ecosystems, suggesting that these areas should be targeted in future measurement campaigns. This study provides predictions of Rs (and associated prediction uncertainty) at unprecedentedly high spatial resolution across the globe that could help constrain local-to-global process-based models. Furthermore, it provides insights into the large variability of Rs and Rh across vegetation classes and identifies regions and vegetation types with poor model performance that should be prioritized for future data collection.},

Models that explicitly represent microbial activity offer inroads to improve representations of soil biogeochemical processes, but have yet to consider relationships between litter quality, functional differences in microbial physiology, and the physical protection of microbial byproducts in forming stable soil organic matter (SOM). To address these limitations, we introduce the MIcrobial-MIneral Carbon Stabilization (MIMICS) model, and evaluate it by comparing site-level soil C projections with observations from a long-term litter decomposition study and soil warming experiment. In MIMICS, the turnover of litter and SOM pools is governed by temperature-sensitive Michaelis--Menten kinetics and the activity of two physiologically distinct microbial functional types. The production of microbial residues through microbial turnover provides inputs to SOM pools that are considered physically or chemically protected. Soil clay content determines the physical protection of SOM in different soil environments. MIMICS adequately simulates the mean rate of leaf litter decomposition observed at temperate and boreal forest sites, and captures observed effects of litter quality on decomposition rates. Moreover, MIMICS better captures the response of SOM pools to experimental warming, with rapid SOM losses but declining temperature sensitivity to long-term warming, compared with a more conventional model structure. MIMICS incorporates current microbial theory to explore the mechanisms by which litter C is converted to stable SOM, and to improve predictions of soil C responses to environmental change.},

Big data refers to large data volume, complex data sets, and multiple data sources. The recent use of such big data is improving our understanding of interactions between biological systems and global environmental changes. In this review, we first explore how big data has been analyzed to identify the general patterns of biological responses to global changes at scales from gene to ecosystem. After that, we investigate how observational networks and space-based big data have facilitated the discovery of emergent mechanisms and phenomena on the regional and global scales. Then, we evaluate the predictions of terrestrial biosphere under global changes by big modeling data. Finally, we introduce some methods to extract knowledge from big data, such as meta-analysis, machine learning, traceability analysis, and data assimilation. The big data has opened new research opportunities, especially for developing new datadriven theories for improving biological predictions in Earth system models, tracing global change impacts across different organismic levels, and constructing cyberinfrastructure tools to accelerate the pace of model-data integrations. These efforts will uncork the bottleneck of using big data to understand biological responses and adaptations to future global changes.},

Given their critical role in the global carbon cycle, Rs measurement and modeling issues have been well reviewed in previous studies. In this paper, we briefly review advances in soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition processes and the factors affecting Rs. We examine the spatial and temporal distribution of Rs measurements available in the literature and found that most of the measurements were conducted in North America, Europe, and East Asia, with major gaps in Africa, East Europe, North Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australia, especially in dry ecosystems. We discuss the potential problems of measuring Rs on slope soils and propose using obliquely-cut soil collars to solve the existing problems. We synthesize previous estimates of global Rs flux and find that the estimates ranged from 50 PgC/yr to 98 PgC/yr and the error associated with each estimation was also high (4 PgC/yr to 33.2 PgC/yr). Using a newly integrated database of Rs measurements and the MODIS vegetation map, we estimate that the global annual Rs flux is 94.3 PgC/yr with an estimation error of 17.9 PgC/yr at a 95\% confidence level. The uneven distribution of Rs measurements limits our ability to improve the accuracy of estimation. Based on the global estimation of Rs flux, we found that Rs is highly correlated with GPP and NPP at the biome level, highlighting the role of Rs in global carbon budgets.},

Despite numerous studies, the interacting responses of Rs to multiple causes of global change are unknown. We combined studies of 178 temperature treatments and 134 precipitation treatments in a global meta-analysis to examine the response of Rs to temperature and precipitation treatments in terrestrial ecosystems. The results showed that the average warming and precipitation increased Rs by 13.1\% and 33.1\%, respectively. The effect sizes of Rs were positive for other global variables (mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), elevation and duration of experiment (DUR)). Moreover, the effect size of Rs decreased exponentially with increasing DUR warming and decreased parabolically with increasing precipitation change, indicating a strong dependence of Rs on global climate conditions. Moreover, the two-way and multi-dimensional interactions of global changing factors have created the positive effects of the individual effects. Rainfall is a key factor in the interaction experiments between precipitation and warming in farmland and urban grassland ecosystems, and other environmental factors interacted significantly with precipitation and temperature, indirectly altering Rs. As multiple global climate change factors often occur simultaneously, it is important to conduct long-term multifactorial experiments to assess the response of Rs to global changes.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystem models (TEMs) contain the coupling of many biogeochemical processes with a large number of parameters involved. In many cases those parameters are highly uncertain. In order to reduce those uncertainties, parameter estimation methods can be applied, which allow the model to be constrained against observations. We compare the performance and results of two such parameter estimation techniques - the Metropolis algorithm (MA) which is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and the adjoint approach as it is used in the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS). Both techniques are applied here to derive the posterior probability density function (PDF) for 19 parameters of the Biosphere Energy Transfer and Hydrology (BETHY) scheme. We also use the MA to sample the posterior parameter distribution from the adjoint inversion. This allows us to assess if the commonly made assumption in variational data assimilation, that everything is normally distributed, holds. The comparison of the posterior parameter PDF derived by both methods shows that in most cases an approximation of the PDF by a normal distribution as used by the adjoint approach is a valid assumption. The results also indicate that the global minimum has been identified by both methods for the given set up. However, the adjoint approach outperforms the MA by several orders of magnitude in terms of computational time. Both methods show good agreement in the PDF of estimated net carbon fluxes for the decades of the 1980s and 1990s.},

  abstract = {As the indispensable role of natural microbial communities in many aspects of life on Earth is uncovered, the bottom-up engineering of synthetic microbial consortia with novel functions is becoming an attractive alternative to engineering single-species systems. Here, we summarize recent work on synthetic microbial communities with a particular emphasis on open challenges and opportunities in environmental sustainability and human health. We next provide a critical overview of mathematical approaches, ranging from phenomenological to mechanistic, to decipher the principles that govern the function, dynamics and evolution of microbial ecosystems. Finally, we present our outlook on key aspects of microbial ecosystems and synthetic ecology that require further developments, including the need for more efficient computational algorithms, a better integration of empirical methods and model-driven analysis, the importance of improving gene function annotation, and the value of a standardized library of well-characterized organisms to be used as building blocks of synthetic communities.},
